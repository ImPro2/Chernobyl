The dedicated guide for Windows.

## Cloning

Clone the engine by typing `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ImPro2/Chernobyl` 
into Command Prompt. 

## Building

You can use the [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
for building the binaries. Another build option will be added later.
Navigate into the `Chernobyl` folder and then into the `Scripts` folder and run `WinGenProjects.bat`. 
After the project files are generated, go to the root directory again and
open `Chernobyl.sln`. Now that Visual Studio is open, right click on the solution
in the `Solution Explorer` tab and click `Build Solution`.

You can now run the engine by pressing F5 or clicking on the green button on top!
